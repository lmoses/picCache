Cache Dem Pics

Thanks for downloading our game! Once you register your username and password(if you are grading it you can use the temporary user/pass of bob/dog), your
game will be available to play with any other registered users. You may also browse for your
registered friend’s games that are available.

The application uses a web-server based SQL storage for user and game image data. Some of the
API’s and services we utilize for the game are:

Phonegap- allows for writing a html document that will be displayed by a device
Php- server side scripting to allow database connection and file handling
HTML5- what the majority of the pages are written in
Jquery/Jquery Mobile- allow paging and the fancy effects that are available
Ajax- to communicate with the php
Phonegap camera API- from phonegap to take pictures
Mysql- Database to store everything


Upon installing the application, a login screen will display first, with an add user button for
first time use. Once you are authenticated, the application will take you to the continue or
create new game page. If you create a new game, your phone camera will come up, and
you may take your picture, and a confirmation screen will follow. Once you confirm your
picture, a text input box will appear for you to input a text hint to set your friends on the right
track, and then the game picture and text is uploaded to the server, and your friends may
now submit your guesses. If you select the continue game, a listing of available games
appears, and you may choose which one to play. Study the picture and figure out where
it may have been taken. Go to the picure’s location and take a picture of your own, and
submit it as a guess. Once submitted, your guess will be computed and either complete the
game or you will be notified to try again.
